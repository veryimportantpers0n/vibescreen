  "Listen to the silence between your thoughts.",
  "Every ending is a new beginning in disguise.",
  "Find peace in the space between heartbeats.",
  "The mountain does not worry about the wind.",
  "Patience is the companion of wisdom.",
  "Let go of what no longer serves your spirit.",
  "In simplicity, discover profound truth.",
  "The river never rushes, yet always arrives.",
  "Breathe in calm, breathe out compassion.",
  "Your inner light needs no external validation."
