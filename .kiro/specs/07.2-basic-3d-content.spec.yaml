name: "Basic 3D Content Implementation"
version: "1.0"
description: "Create basic placeholder 3D scenes and characters to validate the Three.js integration and see the app working"

requirements:
  functional:
    - Create 3 basic personality modes with working 3D content
    - Implement simple animated background scenes
    - Add basic wireframe characters with speak animations
    - Ensure mode switching actually changes the 3D content
    - Test that the terminal commands work with real content

  technical:
    - Use react-three-fiber and drei for all 3D content
    - Keep geometry simple (boxes, spheres, toruses) for performance
    - Implement continuous subtle animations (rotation, scaling)
    - Characters must respond to onSpeak callback
    - All scenes must be full-screen backgrounds

  visual:
    - Match personality mood through colors and movement
    - Use matrix green color scheme as base
    - Corporate AI: Geometric, structured, professional
    - Zen Monk: Organic, flowing, peaceful
    - Chaos: Erratic, colorful, unpredictable

tasks:
  1:

      - Messages appear when using !test command
      - Animations run smoothly at 60fps

  2:
    name: "Create Zen Monk Mode"
    description: "Implement peaceful, organic 3D content"
    requirements:
      - Create flowing, organic background animations
      - Simple meditation figure character

    deliverables:
      - modes/zen-monk/scene.js - Flowing organic shapes
      - modes/zen-monk/character.js - Meditation figure
      - modes/zen-monk/config.json - Peaceful timing settings
      - modes/zen-monk/messages.json - Zen wisdom messages
    
    validation:
      - Smooth organic animations
      - Character has meditation pose
      - Terminal switching works (!switch Zen Monk)
      - Messages have zen-like content

  3:
    name: "Create Chaos Mode"
    description: "Implement erratic, energetic 3D content"
    requirements:
      - Rapid, unpredictable animations
      - Multiple colors and shapes
      - High-energy character movements
      - Fast message timing
      - Chaotic but not nauseating
    
    deliverables:
      - modes/chaos/scene.js - Erratic multi-shape scene
      - modes/chaos/character.js - Energetic character
      - modes/chaos/config.json - Fast timing settings
      - modes/chaos/messages.json - Chaotic messages
    
    validation:
      - Multiple animated elements
      - Character has energetic movements
      - Terminal switching works (!switch Chaos)
      - Fast message rotation

  4:
    name: "Integration Testing"
    description: "Test the complete system with real 3D content"
    requirements:
      - All three modes switch properly
      - Terminal commands work with real content
      - Performance remains smooth
      - No WebGL errors or memory leaks
      - Responsive design works with 3D content
    
    deliverables:
      - Updated ModeLoader.jsx to handle real mode imports
      - Performance validation tests
      - Cross-mode switching validation
      - Memory usage monitoring
    
    validation:
      - Smooth switching between all 3 modes
      - Terminal commands (!switch, !test, !pause) work
      - No console errors
      - Maintains 60fps performance
      - Works on different screen sizes

acceptance_criteria:
  - User can run npm run dev and see working 3D content
  - Terminal commands successfully switch between 3 modes
  - Each mode has distinct visual personality
  - Characters animate when messages appear
  - No performance issues or errors
  - App demonstrates the "Frankenstein" concept clearly

testing:
  unit:
    - Each mode component renders without errors
    - Character onSpeak callbacks function properly
    - Scene animations run continuously
  
  integration:
    - Mode switching updates both scene and character
    - Terminal commands trigger correct mode changes
    - Message system works with real content
  
  performance:
    - Maintains 60fps with all animations
    - Memory usage stays reasonable during mode switching
    - WebGL context handles multiple scene changes

notes:
  - Keep geometry simple - this is proof of concept
  - Focus on getting something working rather than perfection
  - Use placeholder textures and basic materials
  - Prioritize functionality over visual polish
  - This validates the entire architecture works
